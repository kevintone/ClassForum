                    Meteor, or MeteorJS is an open-source JavaScript web application framework[2] written
                    using Node.js. Meteor allows for rapid prototyping and produces cross-platform (web, Android, iOS) code.
                    It integrates with MongoDB and uses the Distributed Data Protocol and a publish–subscribe pattern to
                    automatically propagate data changes to clients without requiring the developer to write any
                    synchronization code. On the client, Meteor depends on jQuery and can be used with any JavaScript
                    UI widget library.

                    HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to
                    create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most
                    websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user
                    interfaces for many mobile applications.[1] Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into
                    visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues
                    for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.

                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                    document written in a markup language.[1] Although most often used to set the visual style of web
                    pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document
                    , including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media.
                    Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create
                    visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many

                    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[5]) is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming
                    language.[6] It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.[7] Alongside HTML
                    and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production;
                    the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins.
                    [6] JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language,
                    supporting object-oriented,[8] imperative, and functional programming styles.[6] It has an API for
                    working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as
                    networking, storage or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which
                    it is embedded

                    MongoDB (from humongous) is a cross-platform document-oriented database. Classified as a NoSQL
                    database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of
                    JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of
                    data in certain types of applications easier and faster. Released under a combination of the GNU
                    Affero General Public License and the Apache License, MongoDB is free and open-source software.
